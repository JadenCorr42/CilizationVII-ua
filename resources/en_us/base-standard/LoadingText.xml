		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_AMINA">
			<Text>The warrior queen Amina rose to power when the trade routes of the Sahara began to provide access to a larger and larger world. A callous and single-minded conqueror, she led the Hausa people on a campaign of expansion across the precolonial Sahel, and she was said to take a lover in every city she vanquished, only to kill him in the morning. In uniting the lands, Amina conquered according to her own fashion — with a sword, not a man, at her side.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_ASHOKA">
			<Text>Lauded as a chakravartin, a “wheel-turning monarch,” for spreading Buddhism, Ashoka had a checkered past. Known for his ferocity as the emperor of the Maurya, Ashoka experienced a profound revelation upon witnessing his slaughter of the Kalinga in 260 BCE. Afterwards, he spread a message of non-violence around his lands and abroad, seeking to steer others away from his own legacy of destruction.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_AUGUSTUS">
			<Text>Emerging from Rome’s civil wars, Augustus consolidated the fractious republic into an empire stretching from the North Sea to Egypt. Despite the Roman fear of tyrants, he achieved sole power while outwardly maintaining the old republic’s structures. He expanded Rome’s borders via client states and a reorganized army, reformed the tax code, and inaugurated the imperial cult. The modern image of Imperial Rome is largely the one of Augustus’ vision.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_BENJAMIN_FRANKLIN">
			<Text>In colonial America, few individuals shone as brightly as Benjamin Franklin. Beginning as a humble printer, he soon established himself as a prominent newspaper publisher. In 1747, he moved into politics and became one of the Founding Fathers, participating in the drafting and signing of the Declaration of Independence. A restless polymath, Franklin also made many contributions to science in fields as diverse as electricity and oceanography.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_CATHERINE">
			<Text>Born a German princess, Catherine the Great overthrew her husband in 1762 to become Empress of Russia. Guided by a vision of modernization, she established new models of law and governance, and oversaw an era of rapid expansion through war and diplomacy. Motivated by intellectual curiosity and love of the arts, Catherine also sponsored creatives, scholars, and scientists, fostering the Russian Enlightenment and its environment of innovation.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_CHARLEMAGNE">
			<Text>Charles the Great, or Charlemagne, began his career as King of the Franks in 768 CE. Having inherited a diverse and restless population, he reforged his kingdom by integrating old traditions with new forms of governance and grew an empire that stretched across Europe. In addition to his political acumen, Charlemagne’s natural curiosity encouraged the Carolingian Renaissance, transforming his court into a hub for diplomats and intellectuals alike.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_CONFUCIUS">
			<Text>Kong Fu Zi, or Confucius, came to prominence during the Zhou Dynasty and turned to writing following a life in government. In contrast to a political climate in which rulers vied for power and succumbed to vice, Confucius cultivated an ethos of order, harmony and tradition. His many writings stress hard work and knowing one’s place — be you ruler or subject, parent or child. Confucian thought would influence East Asian society for centuries hence. </Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_FRIEDRICH">
			<Text>Friedrich the Great’s rise to power in militarized Prussia at first seems contradictory. In his youth he was more interested in art and literature than war. Yet upon taking the throne, he revealed a sharp proclivity for military theory and a taste for Prussian aggression. Friedrich vigorously expanded his borders and solidified Prussia’s martial reputation, but never lost his love of the arts, balancing his iron hand with intellectual patronage.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_HARRIET_TUBMAN">
			<Text>Born Araminta “Minty” Ross to enslaved parents on a Maryland plantation, Harriet Tubman escaped slavery, then helped others do the same via the Underground Railroad, a network of safehouses that led to the free North. She led the Union Army in a raid on Combahee Ferry, rescuing over 700 people, and later became involved in the suffrage movement and other causes. Few have embodied the fight for freedom and equal rights as well as Harriet Tubman. </Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_HATSHEPSUT">
			<Text>The early 14th century BCE saw Egypt flourish beneath the guiding hand of Hatshepsut. During her long tenure Hatshepsut expanded Egypt’s trading empire, establishing networks and influence in the Mediterranean to the north and the rich land of Punt to the south. She channeled the resulting wealth into immense building projects that captured her people’s rich heritage, ensuring the power she cultivated for both Egypt and herself would be immortal.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_HIMIKO">
			<Text>The queen of Yamatai, an early Japanese state, Himiko used her political and religious authority as, possibly, a shaman of the sun-goddess Amaterasu to rule. Her political prowess was recognized by the Chinese kingdom of Cao Wei, who dubbed her a “friend of Wei.” Her authority is echoed in what will become the Empire of Japan for over a thousand years.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_IBN_BATTUTA">
			<Text>Down the trade routes of Africa, Asia, and Europe traveled Ibn Battuta, a scholar and chronicler born of a Moroccan and Berber family in 1325. After performing the Hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, he went on to explore the Dar Al-Islam (the known Muslim world). Through his travelogue, the Rihla, Ibn Battuta's insights into his world, and the lives of those he shared it with, continue to inspire like-minded travelers.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_ISABELLA">
			<Text>Queen Isabella of Spain had a single vision – the growth of her nation’s power. At home, she dedicated herself to establishing Spain’s next chapter as a bastion of Catholicism and oversaw the violence of the Inquisition and the Reconquista. Abroad, she sponsored the expansion of Spanish might into the New World. Clever and ruthless, Isabella built the groundwork for Spain’s future upon war and wealth.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_JOSE_RIZAL">
			<Text>Long regarded as a hero of the Philippines, José Rizal was a passionate defender of the dignity and autonomy of Filipinos. He first gained his reputation as a political activist in Europe, criticizing the Spanish rule of his homeland, and though he advocated for peaceful reform and equal rights, Rizal was eventually tried and executed by the Spanish. Yet his revolutionary spirit could not be contained, and has inspired Filipinos ever since. </Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_LAFAYETTE">
			<Text>Gilbert du Motier, the Marquis de Lafayette, made his mark on two continents, leading troops in the American revolution, and being a voice of reason in France, between the twin horrors of autocracy and revolutionary retribution. While his legacy is impressive, his most skillful feat may simply be survival at the center of some of the greatest tumult of his time.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_PACHACUTI">
			<Text>Having defended it from invasion, Pachacuti assumed rule over the kingdom of Cuzco around 1438 and soon began to conquer neighboring regions. He had military and political prowess in equal measure — those he could not take by force he plied with gifts, promising autonomy and prosperity in exchange for loyalty. The Inca Empire would only continue for some sixty years after his death, when the Spanish came, but Pachacuti’s legacy endures nonetheless.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_MACHIAVELLI">
			<Text>The name of Florentine writer, diplomat and philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli has become synonymous with duplicity and treachery. He argued that the most effective ruler was one willing to do whatever it took to gain, retain and wield power. Such views won him the ire of both the Catholic Church and the powerful Medici dynasty. But his ideas live on in his posthumous work The Prince — giving him, in true Machiavellian fashion, the last word. </Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_TRUNG_TRAC">
			<Text>For a brief period in what is now Vietnam, two sisters, Trung Trac and Trung Nhi, stood against the might of the Han Dynasty. When her husband was sentenced to death, Trung Trac and her sister fought on, gaining independence for three years before the Han counterattack. They are still held up as symbols of Vietnamese independence, and divinities in their own right.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_XERXES">
			<Text>Xerxes I inherited the Achaemenid Empire at a time of crisis and guided it to greatness. Swiftly crushing two uprisings upon taking power, he set his sights on Greece and invaded in 480 BCE. After defeat at Salamis ended his European ambitions, Xerxes shifted his attention from expansion to enrichment, devoting his treasury to architectural masterpieces, testaments to the triumph he bestowed on his people and the fear he provoked in his enemies.</Text>
